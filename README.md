# Adblocker blocker blocker

![Logo](https://github.com/dkleiman/adblockerblockerblocker/raw/master/icon128.png)

Small browser extension to block simple sites that block adblocker based on the stackoverflow answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10412651/how-can-i-remove-script-elements-before-they-are-being-executed).

Just click on the icon to run a script that reloads the page with none of their javascript.

So far it works on:

* <http://wwww.wired.com>

Sites that are too complicated for it (it just kills the page):

* <http://forbes.com>
